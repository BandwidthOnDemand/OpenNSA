"""
Module for constants in OpenNSA.

Often the same constants are used in multiple modules where one does not want
cross-imports, like protocols/nsi2 and topology. This module gives a place to
keep them all. While not being particularly elegant it does solve a real
problem.

It is recommend to import this module as 'cnt' to keep the prefix short, but
also the same in the code base.
