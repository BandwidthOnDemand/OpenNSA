Adminstrative interface
 - First considered with domainsocket, but tests showed it to be weird
   - And it makes it hard to put things on different boxes
 - Functionality: List ports, list connections, generate tokens (in the future), etc

Iterative tree aggregator

Add x509host stanza for port authZ
 - Implemented for provider side (upa level, which is fine)
 - Aggregator should perform authorization on its requester API as well.
   - This is slightly tricky as NSA-hostname correlation must be known.

It _might_ be possible to get OpenNSA to try and bring up the same
cross-connect multiple times by issuing provision request concurrently. Look
into this.

Make the aggregator use reserveAbort instead of terminate when aborting

Make a simple REST interface for clients
 - Several users have asked for an easier interface (not a cli)
 - Kill as much functionality as possible
   - Have auto commit / provision
   - No timezones
   - Long-pull for state
   - Time log for state transitions (unix time, state)
 - And maybe support interface metrics (check juniper capabilities)

Better debugging on SSH backends

Registry, they are not necessarely events or service. Just a registry. (just some renaming)

Log rotation

Long term:
  Mailing list
  Improve the web interface (it shows the connections)
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Ability to generate topology from NRM mapping / internal topology description

Client:
  Should the client should be able to breakout request itself

Backends:
  Force10: Should do shutdown when interfaces are not in use
  Test on Juniper EX switch
  Test on Juniper virtual router
  JunOS:
    Failure handling is terrible for command sending
    Log success/failure instead of commands (only on debug)
  SSH module does not notifiy login timeouts
