Domain socket option in config
 - option name: adminsocket, domainsocket,
 - Actually, do not use domain sockets (they suck)
 - Make an adminstrative interface with auth (or restrict to localhost)

Add x509host stanza for port authZ
 - Implemented for provider side (upa level, which is fine)
 - Aggregator should perform authorization on its requester API as well.
   - This is slightly tricky as NSA-hostname correlation must be known.

It _might_ be possible to get OpenNSA to try and bring up the same
cross-connect multiple times by issuing provision request concurrently. Look
into this.

Make the aggregator use reserveAbort instead of terminate when aborting

Make a simple REST interface for clients
 - Several users have asked for an easier interface (not a cli)
 - Kill as much functionality as possible
   - Have auto commit / provision
   - No timezones
   - Long-pull for state
   - Time log for state transitions (unix time, state)
 - And maybe support interface metrics (check juniper capabilities)


NSIv2 BOD Service
 - Check nsidev logs and improve them
 - Better error messages on bindings (sigh...)


Better debugging on SSH backends

Issues:

- Make replyTo optional (assuming sync. query)

- Better aggregate error handling
- Better logging in aggregation failures
- NSI2 Detail Query

- Label support in topology and backends
- Rework all error throwing handling to new error infrastructure
- Rename shared.resource to shared.soapresource

Registry, they are not necessarely events or service. Just a registry. (just some renaming)

Log rotation

Long term:
  Mailing list
  Improve the web interface (it shows the connections)
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Ability to generate topology from NRM mapping / internal topology description


General:
  Client should be able to breakout request itself


Backends:
  Force10: Should do shutdown when interfaces are not in use
  Test on Juniper EX switch
  Test on Juniper virtual router
  JunOS:
    Failure handling is terrible for command sending
    Log success/failure instead of commands (only on debug)
  SSH module does not notifiy login timeouts
