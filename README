OpenNSA is a reference implementation of the Network Service Agent, which
includes an NSI interface.

NSI (Network Service Interface) is (or should be) a protocol agnostic interface
for provisioning network links, i.e., providing networking as a service.

There are several documents concerning NSI. See the OGF work group page for the
latest revisions. http://forge.gridforum.org/sf/projects/nsi-wg

OpenNSA consists of several modules for various functionality. These include
topology database and parser, protocol handlers, and the core agent itself.

OpenNSA is currently in a state of heavy prototyping and nothing is set in
stone, and there are probably more temporary constructions in the code than
final.

Requirements:

* Python 2.6 or newer (Python 3 will not work)

* Twisted, http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/

* SUDS,https://fedorahosted.org/suds/
  Important: SUDS 0.4 has issues with namespaces and a DST/Timezone issues.
  See the following bugs:
  - https://fedorahosted.org/suds/ticket/292
  - https://fedorahosted.org/suds/ticket/353
  There are patches for these in the patches directory.

These should be included in the package system in most recent Linux distributions.

If you use a backend which uses SSH (JunOS, Force10), there is a patch to
remove some of the log statements in the Twisted SSH module, which is rather
noisy. This makes the log a lot easier to read.


Command line tool:

Start test service:
twistd -noy opennsa.tac

Make a reservation:
./onsa reserve -u http://localhost:9080/NSI/services/ConnectionService -p OpenNSA-HTJClient -r Aruba -s Aruba:A1 -d Aruba:A4

Do a ./onsa --help for more information.
