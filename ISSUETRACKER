This is the OpenNSA issue tracker :-)

Stuff to do:
  Proper state changes in aggregation states
  Better error reporting (per network) wrt. failures
  Investigate error message on connection id
  TLS (send mail aswell)
  Configuration


General:
  Connection state layering problem (top state only updated on commands)
  Better handling of aggregation failures (partial or not)
  Persistence for connections
  Cleanups (mostly in backends)
  Command line client (Jeroen and HTJ will have a fight-off about which to use :-) )
  More backends :-)


Argia backend:
  State scheduling to terminated does not work.
  Switch to using calendar and scheduler
  Use the query interface

DUD backend:
  Switch to using calendar and scheduler
