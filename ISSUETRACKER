This is the OpenNSA issue tracker :-)

Stuff to do:
  Better error reporting (per network) wrt. failures
  Investigate error message on connection id
  TLS (send mail aswell)
  Configuration


General:
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Connection state layering problem (top state only updated on commands)
  Better handling of aggregation failures (partial or not)
  Persistence for connections
  Command line client (Jeroen and HTJ will have a fight-off about which to use :-) )
  More backends :-)


Argia backend:
  State scheduling to terminated does not work.
  Switch to using calendar and scheduler
  Use the query interface

DUD backend:
  Switch to using calendar and scheduler
