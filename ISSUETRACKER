This is the OpenNSA issue tracker :-)

Stuff to do:
  Send provisonConfirmed/Failed when provision actually happens/fail
  Better handling and reporting of aggregation failures (partial or not)
  Investigate error message on connection id
  Scheduled switch doesn't schedule termination.
  TLS (send mail aswell)
  Configuration


General:
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Persistence for connections
  Command line client (Jeroen and HTJ will have a fight-off about which to use :-) )
  More backends :-)


Argia backend:
  State scheduling to terminated does not work.
  Switch to using calendar and scheduler
  Use the query interface
