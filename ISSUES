General:

  Documentation :-)
  Path computation in CLI
  Make CLI setup more like regular config to lessen confusion
  Persistence for connections
  Seperate protocol stack from connection (done for provider, client still needs work)
  Deal with bandwidth in calendar (requires joint resource concept)
  Profiling of protocol stack / backends
  Twisted SSH stack is very log noisy - Submit patches and have patches
  Failing to send reserveConf can keep connection in INITIAL
  Need an easy way to see active/scheduled/future connections
  connection.py and simplebackend.py steps on each others toes in scheduled teardown

 Client:

  TLS for client service - URL creation is heuristic -> suck!
  Better connection names - use UUIDs for global ids


Backends:
  Multiple switches support
  NCS backend
  Force10: Should do shutdown when interfaces are not in use
  JunOS:
    Failure handling is terrible for command sending
    Log success/failure instead of commands (only on debug)
