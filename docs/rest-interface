List connections (filter)   GET     /connections
Get connection information  GET     /connections/{connection_id}
Get connection status       GET     /connections/{connection_id}/status

the /status is longpull (server won't close connection but will update continously)

Enable:

In [service] section:

rest=true


Example minimal payload to create connnection:

}
"""

More flags:

    Possibility to designate connection id
    Time zones in datetime, always utc (end with Z)
