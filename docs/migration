== Migration from network to domain ==

With the port of OpenNSA from Python 2 to Python 3, support for multiple
backends was added. For this, some changes in the configuration format was
needed.


Old style:


[service]
network=aruba.net
nrmmap=aruba.nrm

[dud]

Equivalent config in new style:

[service]
domain=aruba.net

[dud:topology]
nrmmap=aruba.nrm


Multiple backends:

[service]
domain=aruba.net

[dud:topology1]
nrmmap=aruba-topo1.nrm

[dud:topology1]
nrmmap=aruba-topo2.nrm

Feel free to call your networks something better than topology, but use
'topology' if you want to support the old STP names.
