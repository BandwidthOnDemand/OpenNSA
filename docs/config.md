OpenNSA configuration
---------------------


**Example configuration:**

```
[service]
network=Aruba
logfile=nsalog.log
nrmfile=ports.nrm

peers=http://host.example.org:9080/NSI/discovery.xml

policies=requiretrace,requireuser

serviceid_start=1900000

# Database
database=opennsa
dbuser=dbuser
dbpassword=dbpassword
dbhost=127.0.0.1

[dud]

* Service block


network  : The network name managed by OpenNSA. Mandatory.

logfile  : File to log to.
           Defaults to /var/log/opennsa.log

nrmmap   : Path to port/topology NRM description file

peers    : URLs to NSAs to peer with control-plane wise.
           Seperate multiple entries with newline.
           Optional. No peers will put OpenNSA into UPA mode.

policies : What policies are required. Currently requiretrace, requireuser,
           and aggregator are the possible options. These require a connection
           trace, a user security attribute, and allow proxy aggregation
           respecitively. Optional.

serviceid_start : Initial service id to set in the database. Requires a plugin
                  to use. Optional.

database : Name of the PostgreSQL databse to connect to. Mandatory.

dbuser   : Username to use when connecting to database. Mandatory.

dbpassword : Password to use when connecting to database. Mandatory.

dbhost   : Host to connect to for database. Optional.
           OpenNSA does not require anything big from the datebase, so using a
           different host/vm is almost surely a waste of resources. It is
           however useful when running a PostgreSQL in docker.

** NRM Configuration **

Configuration the nrm file is typically the most confusing parts of setting up
OpenNSA. In short the NRM file defines the ports available through the NSI
protocol, as OpenNSA does not make everything available. An NRM is line based
and typically looks like this:

```
# type      name    remote                              label               bandwith    interface   attributes

ethernet    ps      -                                   vlan:1780-1799,2000 1000        em0         user=johndoe@example.org
ethernet    bon     bonaire.net:topology#arb(-in|-out)  vlan:1780-1799      1000        em3         restricttransit
ethernet    cur     curacao.net:topology#arb(-in|-out)  vlan:1780-1799      1000        em3         restricttransit,hostdn=curacao.example.net

```

Each line describes a port.

* Type

The port type. Only ethernet is recognized at the moment. Bidirectional is implied here.

* Name

The name of the port. The port address will be a URN with the network and port name in it.

* Remote

The network and port the port is connected to. Format:

network#port(-inprefix|-outprefix)

Use '-' if not connected to any network (local termination port).

* Label

Port configuration options. Only VLANs supported for now. Can specify single values and ranges. Comma seperated.

Use '-' if no labels are to be used (i.e., trunk for vlan).

* Bandwidth

The available bandwidth on the port (or the bandwidth that is available to OpenNSA).

* Interface

The port on the corresponding NRM / network equipment. 

* Attributes

A list of comma seperated attributes that describes security attributes or
policies for the port. Security attributes always have the form 'key=value',
otherwise it is a policy. Despite the name, security attributes are not very
secure.

The hostdn will match against the hostname of a certificate. For this to work
OpenNSA must be configured to run with TLS (see docs/tls-guide).

The only supported policy at the moment as restricttransit (OpenNSA will _NOT_
allow ports that both have restricttransit cannot be connected).
